## Cypress
Cypress is an open-source and free test automation tool, which can be used extensively in the long run. It is mainly used for front-end test automation. This tool is mainly developed to solve the issues that the teams face while automating an application.
## About the Project
In this project, I automate the <b>OrangeHRM</b> website with <b>Cypress</b> for UI testing. It may help me to be a good Software Quality Assurance Engineer.
I do my work step by step. I have faced many issues during this project, and happy to handle them professionally.
